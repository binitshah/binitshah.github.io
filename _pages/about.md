I am currently working at [Hello Robot Inc.](https://hello-robot.com/), a startup whose first product is a robot called Stretch. [Stretch](https://robots.ieee.org/robots/stretch/) is a compact, lightweight, and force-sensitive mobile manipulator that is well suited to working in homes and workplaces. I wear many hats at Hello Robot, but I primarily drive development of Stretch's software stack. Feel free to peruse my work Github account, [@hello-binit](https://github.com/hello-binit), since nearly all of our software packages are open source. Previously, I was a BS-MS student at Georgia Tech where I contributed to research on robotic art, task planning and recovery, and acted as a teaching assistant for CS3630, the intro robotics course at Georgia Tech.
